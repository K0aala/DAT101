      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				[You should use constants in places where the value isnt supposed to change. 
        If the value of "x" never changes that is when you'd use a constant (aka "cosnt"), 
        if you would like for the value of x to change that is when the use of a variable (aka "let").]
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				[you have to do the parentheses first.]
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				[with the command ".toFixed()" and putting the amount of decimals you'd like inside of the parentheses.]
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				[The signs ">, <" are used to calculate the number of the highest value.]
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				[Comparison operators can compare numbers or strings and carry out evaluations. 
        Comparison operator return either 1 = true or 0 = false. You can use "==" to compare to values, and it will return as wither true or false]
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				[Math.random() returns any random number, and you're able to change the parameters of the random number by adding it to the function.]
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				[the modulus "%" returns the remainder of a division.]
